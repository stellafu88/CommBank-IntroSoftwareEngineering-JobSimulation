      <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Financial institutions work to protect your financial information, but
          you also play a vital role. While cybercrime can't be entirely
          prevented, understanding account takeovers and taking proactive steps
          can help secure your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          A customer account takeover happens when criminals steal login
          credentials to access personal accounts, often financial ones. Some
          mix real and fake data to create fraudulent accounts for their
          benefit.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch What You Click</strong>Â 
          <p>
            Visit official websites or apps instead of clicking on suspicious
            links to avoid malware.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protect Your Personal Information</strong>
          <p>
            Don't share sensitive information unless you verify the request.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Strong Password</strong>
          <p>
            Create long, unpredictable passwords with a mix of characters,
            update them regularly, use different password for each account, and
            use a password manager.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</strong>
          <p>
            Add extra security layers like SMS codes or biometric verification.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain Device Security</strong>
          <p>
            Use up-to-date security software, operating system and web browser,
            and enable automatic updates.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Back Up Your Files</strong>

          <strong>Use Your Own Device</strong>
          <p>
            Avoid using public computers to access your financial accounts. If
            you must use them, be sure to clear the cache and history after
            logging out.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Browse Carefully</strong>

            Ensure sites begin with "https" and have a padlock symbol. Avoid
            opening multiple webpages in a single browser. Always log out after
            use.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be Cyber Safe When Using Wi-Fi</strong>

            home Wi-Fi.

        <li>
          <strong>Monitor Financial Correspondence and Accounts</strong>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Research companies before transactions</strong>
